            1. Intro HTML
        </h3>
        <p>You may know that HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. <br>
            <br>
            The HyperText part refers to the fact that HTML allows you to create links that allow visitors to move from one page to another quickly and easily. <br>
            <br>
            A markup language allows you to annotate text, and these annotations provide additional meaning to the contents of a document. <br>
            <br>
            If you think of a web page, we add code around the original text we want to display and the browser then uses the code to display the page correctly. So the tags we add are the markup.<br>
            </p>
        <h4 id="list1.1">
            1.1: How Pages Use Structure HTML
        </h4>
        <p>
        In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to structure documents. <br>
        <br>
        Think about the stories you read in a newspaper: for each story, there will be a headline, some text, and possibly some images. If the article is a long piece, there may be subheadings that split the story into separate sections or quotes from those involved. Structure helps readers understand the stories in the newspaper.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        ● See how HTML describes the structure of a web page <br>
        <br>
        ● Learn how tags or elements are added to your document <br>
        <br>
        ● Write your first web page
        </p>

        <h4 id="list1.2">
            1.2: Tags
        </h4>
        <img width="300" height="300" src="Imgs/Picture1.png">
        <img width="300" height="300" src="Imgs/Picture2.png">


        <h4 id="list1.3">
            1.3: Text Body, Head & Title
        </h4>
        <p>
            You met the "body" element in the first example we created. Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.<br>
            <br>
                Before the "body" element you will often see a "head" element. This contains information about the page (rather than
                information that is shown within the main part of the browser
                window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite page).
                You will usually find a "title" element inside the "head"
                element.<br>
                <br>
                The contents of the "title" element are either shown in the
                top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).
                
        </p>
        <h4>
            Headings
        </h4>
        <p>
            HTML has six "levels" of headings:<br>
            <br>
            "h1" Is used for main headings<br>
            "h2" is used for subheadings<br>
            If there are further sections under the subheadings then the
            "h3" element is used, and so on...
                
        </p>
        <h4>
            Paragraphs & Bold
        </h4>
        <p>
            To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening "p" tag and closing "/p" tag.<br>
            <br>
            By enclosing words in the tags "b" and "/b" we can make characters appear bold.    
        </p>

        <h4>
            Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules
        </h4>
        <p>
            If you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag "br /"<br>
            <br>
            To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the tag.    
        </p>

        <h4 id="list1.4">
            1.4: List
        </h4>
        <p>
            HTML provides us with three different types:<br>
            <br>
● Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.<br>
<br>
● Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).<br>
<br>
● Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

        </p>

        <h4 id="list1.5">
            1.5: Links
        </h4>
        <p>
            Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.<br>
            <br>
You will commonly come across the following types of links: <br>
<br>
● Links from one website to another <br>
<br>
● Links from one page to another on the same website <br>
<br>
● Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same  page <br>
<br>
● Links that open in a new browser window <br>
<br>
● Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone<br>
<br>
Links are created using the "a" element. Users can click on anything between the opening "a" tag and the closing "/a" tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.<br>
<br>
When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is known as an absolute URL.<br>
<br>
When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.<br>
<br>
Before you can link to a specific part of a page, you need to identify the points in the page that the link will go to. You do this using the id attribute (which can be used on every HTML element). <br>
<br>
You can see that the "h1" and "/h1" elements in this example have been given id attributes that identify those sections of the page.<br>
<br>
The value of the id attribute should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character) and, on a single page, no two id attributes should have the same value
        </p>

        <h4 id="list1.6">
            1.6: Images
        </h4>
        <p>
            You will also often see an "img" element use two other attributes that specify its size: height This specifies the height of the image in pixels. width This specifies the width of the image in pixels.

        </p>
        <h3 id="list2">
            2. Intro CSS
        </h3>
        <p>
            The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element. <br>
            <br>
            CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.

        </p>
        <p>
            The "link" element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. It is an empty element (meaning it does not need a closing tag), and it lives inside the element. It should use three attributes:<br>
            <br>
Href: This specifies the path to the CSS file (which is often placed in a folder called css or styles).<br>
<br>
Type: This attribute specifies the type of document being linked to. The value should be text/css.<br>
<br>
Rel: This specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The value should be stylesheet when linking to a CSS file.

        </p>

        <h3 id="list3">
            3. Intro to JavaScript
        </h3>
        <h4 id="list3.1">
            3.1: Variables
        </h4>
        <p>
            There are three ways to initialize a variable in JavaScript:<br>
            <br>
            ● Using "var", where the value and type of the variable can be modified<br>
            ● Using "const", where the value of the variable should not be changed<br>
            ● Using "let", which works similar to var, but is used when declaring global variables<br>
            <br>
            It is not necessary to specify if the variable is numeric, made with characters or otherwise,
            since JavaScript handles it on its own.<br>
            Still, JavaScript does save the type that a certain variable is holding, the basic types are:<br>
            ● Numbers, which is any value made up of numeric characters<br>
            ● Strings, which are used to represent text. They are written by enclosing their content in quotes<br>
            ● Booleans, which have just two values, true and false, written as those words.<br>
        </p>
        <h4 id="list3.2">
            3.2: Logical Operators
        </h4>
        <p>
            JavaScript supports three logical operators: and, or, and not. These can be used to “reason” about Booleans.<br>
            <br>
            The && operator represents logical and. It is a binary operator, and its result is true only if both the values given to it are true.<br>
            The || operator denotes logical or. It produces true if either of the values given to it is true.<br>
            Not is written as an exclamation mark (!). It is a unary operator that flips the value given to it—!true produces false and !false gives true.<br>

            The last logical operator we will look at is not unary, not binary, but ternary, operating on three values. It is written with a question mark and a colon, like this:<br>
            console.log(true ? 1 : 2);<br>
            // → 1<br>
            <br>
            The ?? operator resembles ||, but returns the value on the right only if the one on the left is null or undefined, not if it is some other value that can be converted to false. Often, this is preferable to the behavior of ||.
        </p>

        <h4 id="list3.3">
            3.3: Functions
        </h4>
        <p>
            Functions are one of the most central tools in JavaScript programming. The concept of wrapping a piece of program in a value 
            has many uses. It gives us a way to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition, to associate names with subprograms, and 
            to isolate these subprograms from each other.<br>
            <br>
            const square = function(x) {<br>
            return x * x;<br>
            };<br>
            console.log(square(12));<br>
            // → 144

        </p>
        <h4 id="list3.4">
            3.4: Control Flow
        </h4>
        <p>
            When your program contains more than one statement, the statements are executed as though they were a story, from top to bottom.<br>
            Not all programs are straight roads. We may, for example, want to create a branching road where the program takes the proper branch based 
            on the situation at hand. This is called conditional execution.<br>
            Conditional execution is created with the if keyword in JavaScript. In the simple case, we want some code to be executed if, and only 
            if, a certain condition holds.<br>
        </p>
        <img width="330" height="250" src="Imgs/ifStatement.png">
        <p>
            We also have the switch statement, which evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value against a series of case clauses, and executes statements
            after the first case clause with a matching value, until a break statement is encountered. The default clause of a switch statement will 
            be jumped to if no case matches the expression's value.<br>
        </p>
        <img width="330" height="250" src="Imgs/switchStatement.png">

        <h4 id="list3.5">
            3.5. Cycles in JavaScript
        </h4>
        <p>
            Cycles allow you to repeat a piece of code multiple times, either by a defined amount or
            based on a condition<br>
            The declarations for loops in JavaScript are:<br>
            <br>
            ● for<br>
            Repeats the code inside of it a defined amount of times<br><br>
            <img width="410" height="100" src="Imgs/forLoop.png"><br>
            ● while<br>
            Repeats the code inside of it as long as the condition holds true<br><br>
            <img width="260" height="150" src="Imgs/whileLoop.png"><br>
            ● do...while<br>
            Similar to the while loop, but in this case it will run the code inside of itself at least once.<br>
            ● for...in<br>
            Iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object, like going through all the elements in a list for example<br>
            ● for...of<br>
            Similar to the for...in, except the variable that is iterating over the object, saves the value of the cell, instead of its index.

            4.2: Hooks
        </h4>
        <p>
            Hooks let you use different React features from your components. You can either use the built-in Hooks or combine them to build your own. <br>
            <br>
<b>State Hooks</b> <br>
<br>
State lets a component “remember” information like user input. For example, a form component can use state to store the input value, while an image gallery component can use state to store the selected image index.<br>
<br>
<b>Effect Hooks</b> <br>
<br>
Effects let a component connect to and synchronize with external systems. This includes dealing with network, browser DOM, animations, widgets written using a different UI library, and other non-React code.<br>

            4.3: Data Structure: Object and Arrays
        </h4>
        <p>
            Numbers, Booleans, and strings are the atoms from which data structures are built.<br>
            <br>
<b>Data Sets</b><br>
<br>
To work with a chunk of digital data, we first have to find a way to represent it in our machine’s memory. Say, for example, that we want to represent a collection of the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.<br>
<br>
let listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];<br>
<br>
console.log(listOfNumbers[2]);<br>
// → 5<br>
console.log(listOfNumbers[0]);<br>
// → 2<br>
console.log(listOfNumbers[2 - 1]);<br>
// → 3<br>
<br>
<b>Objects</b><br><br>
The binary in operator, when applied to a string and an object, tells you whether that object has a property with that name.<br>
<br>
let anObject = {left: 1, right: 2};<br>
console.log(anObject.left);<br>
// → 1<br>
delete anObject.left;<br>
console.log(anObject.left);<br>
// → undefined<br>
<br>
console.log("left" in anObject);<br>
// → false<br>
console.log("right" in anObject);<br>
// → true<br>
<br>
To find out what properties an object has, you can use the Object.keys function.<br>
<br>
console.log(Object.keys({x: 0, y: 0, z: 2}));<br>
// → (3) ['x', 'y', 'z']<br>


        </p>

            4.4: Methods
        </h4>
        <p>
            Both string and array values contain, in addition to the length property, a number of properties that hold function values.<br>
            <br>
let doh = "Doh";<br>
<br>
console.log(typeof doh.toUpperCase);<br>
// → function<br>
<br>
console.log(doh.toUpperCase());<br>
// → DOH<br>
<br>
This example demonstrates two methods you can use to manipulate arrays:<br>
<br>
let sequence = [1, 2, 3];<br>
<br>
sequence.push(4);<br>
sequence.push(5);<br>
<br>
console.log(sequence);<br>
// → (5) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
console.log(sequence.pop());<br>
// → 5<br>
console.log(sequence);<br>
// → (4) [1, 2, 3, 4]<br>
